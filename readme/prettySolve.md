# prettySolve.py

`pretty_solve.py` is a Python program that provides an interactive and visually enhanced version of the Digit Solver. It allows you to input the numbers and target digit, and then interactively loops through the possible solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before using `prettySolve.py`, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- solver.py
- pretty_solve.py

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. dowload the solver folder and Navigate to that directory.

3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   python solver/util/pretty_solve
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the required inputs.

   - **Enter numbers allowed separated by space:** Enter the list of numbers allowed for the puzzle, separated by spaces. For example, `3 12 15 20 23 25`.

   - **Enter the target number:** Enter the target number for the puzzle.

5. Once the inputs are provided, the program will start calculating and display the possible solutions.

   - Press the **Enter** key to iterate through the solutions one by one.

   - Press **Ctrl+C** to exit the program.

6. The program will continue calculating until all solutions are displayed or you choose to exit.

   - If all solutions are displayed, the program will show the total number of solutions found.

   - If you choose to exit before displaying all solutions, the program will indicate that the computation has stopped.
